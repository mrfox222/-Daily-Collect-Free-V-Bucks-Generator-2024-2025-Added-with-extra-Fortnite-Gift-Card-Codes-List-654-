Redeem a gift card for V-Bucks to use in Fortnite on any supported device! To use a gift card you must have a valid Epic Account, download Fortnite on a compatible device, and accept the applicable terms and user agreement. Review your device maker’s terms for any additional requirements to play Fortnite (e.g., subscriptions, additional fees). Visit fortnite.com/vbuckscardterms to read the full terms before purchasing.

The card’s full face-value is deducted at redemption and associated with a single account for the device you select (no transfer or withdrawal). A gift card can only be redeemed for the indicated amount of V-Bucks, which may only be used in Fortnite.

There are no fees or expiration dates associated with the use of a gift card. V-Bucks aren’t e-money or any other currency and can only be used according to Fortnite’s rules. Gift cards will not be replaced if lost, stolen, destroyed, or used without permission. Use of a gift card constitutes acceptance of the applicable terms and user agreement.
